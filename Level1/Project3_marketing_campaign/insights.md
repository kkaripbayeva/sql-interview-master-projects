***Project 3: Marketing Campaign Insights***
1. Campaign Performance & Conversion
The Campaign 2 Failure: Campaign 2 was the least successful, with only 30 acceptances. In contrast, Campaigns 3 and 5 were the top performers (163 acceptances each).

2. Customer Segmentation & "Whales"
Spending Leadership: The maximum total spend by a single customer reached $2,525. These "Whales" represent the highest customer lifetime value (CLV).

Education Impact: Customers with a "Graduation" level of education represent the largest volume of records (1,127), but PhD and Master segments show higher average spending per transaction.

3. Channel Attribution & Engagement
Offline Dominance: Despite digital trends, Physical Stores remain the primary purchase channel (12,970 total purchases), significantly outperforming Web and Catalog sales.

The Digital Browsing Paradox: High website visit frequency (numwebvisitsmonth) does not always correlate with high web purchases. This suggests customers use the website for research/browsing but prefer finalizing high-value purchases in-store or via catalog.

4. Behavioral Indicators
Recency: The average customer has not made a purchase in 49 days.

Super-Fans: A small segment of customers accepted 3 or more campaigns. These are brand advocates who should be moved into a "Loyalty/VIP" program with exclusive, non-discounted offers.
