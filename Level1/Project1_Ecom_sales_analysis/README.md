# Project 1 — Analyze Amazon Sales Data 📦

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed **real-world e-commerce sales data** to uncover trends and performance metrics.  
My goal was to practice **foundational SQL skills**, including data filtering, cleaning, aggregation, and summarization, while exploring a real dataset.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, I aimed to:

- Write SQL queries using `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE`  
- Clean and filter data using logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`)  
- Aggregate and summarize data using SQL functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`)  
- Gain confidence exploring a real-world dataset and answering business questions  
- Build a portfolio-ready SQL project

## Dataset
- **File:** `AmazonSaleReport.csv`  
- **Source:** Kaggle or provided dataset  
I uploaded it to my PostgreSQL database to start exploring and analyzing the data.

## Practice Questions — Beginner to Advanced

### 🔹 Level 1: Basic Overview
1. How many total sales records are in the dataset?  
2. What is the total revenue generated across all sales?  
3. How many unique SKUs were sold?  
4. Which product category had the highest total quantity sold?  
5. What is the average sales amount per transaction?

### 🔹 Level 2: Filtering and Simple Aggregation
6. How many sales were B2B transactions vs non-B2B?  
7. How many sales were made for each product size?  
8. Which fulfilment method was used most frequently?  
9. Which month had the highest total sales revenue?  
10. How many sales were made for each region or country? *(if the dataset includes location)*

### 🔹 Level 3: Intermediate Analysis
11. What are the top 5 most sold SKUs based on quantity?  
12. Which product category generated the highest total revenue?  
13. What is the average order value per customer type (B2B vs non-B2B)?  
14. Which day of the week had the highest sales volume?  

### 🔹 Level 4: Advanced Insights
15. How does monthly revenue trend — are there seasonal spikes?  
16. What is the percentage contribution of each product category to total revenue?  
17. Which SKUs or categories have the highest average order value?  
18. How do B2B vs non-B2B sales compare over time — are there noticeable trends?

## Deliverables
- My SQL queries answering all the questions above

## Tips I Followed
- I started with **basic counts and sums**, then moved to filtering and aggregation.  
- I used **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** to summarize and sort my results.  
- I applied **CASE WHEN** and **COALESCE** to handle conditional logic and NULL values.  
- I committed my SQL scripts to GitHub frequently to track my progress.
